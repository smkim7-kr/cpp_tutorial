| tutorial                    | tl;dr                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 01_variables                | variables have diverse data types - int, float, bool etc.    |
| 02_functions                | functions are useful when to use modularize the code or when repeated codes exists |
| 03_header_files             | ".h" header files have declaration of functions              |
| 04_conditions               | conditions and branching jumps different areas of memory, thus there are overheads |
| 05_loops                    | while and for - when same codes are required to be executed multiple times |
| 06_control_flow             | continue, break, return - determine when to end a loop/function |
| 07_pointers                 | pointers are the number which stores memory address; types of pointers doesn't matter! |
| 08_references               | references does not occupy extra memory unlike pointers, it needs to reference existing variable |
| 09_class_structs            | class and structs are ways to group data and functionality, and useful for object-oriented programming |
| 10_class_design             | set member variables private, retrieve/update member variables by public Get()/Set() methods |
| 11_static                   | static keyword is used to declare variable/function that is visible to current file. When static keyword is used inside class/struct, it's are shared by all class/struct instances |
| 12_enums                    | enums group variables with logical sense                     |
| 13_constructors_destructors | constructor/destructor is a special type of function when instantiating/destroying the object |
| 14_inheritance              | inheritance creates hierarchy of classes, inherited class can access non-private members/methods of parent classes |
| 15_virtual_functions        | to overwrite function of child class, base class function need to be virtual; virtual functions takes computational overhead |
| #TODO                       | #TODO                                                        |
|                             |                                                              |
|                             |                                                              |
|                             |                                                              |
|                             |                                                              |
|                             |                                                              |
|                             |                                                              |
|                             |                                                              |
|                             |                                                              |
|                             |                                                              |
|                             |                                                              |
